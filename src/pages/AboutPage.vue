      An image is a visual representation of something, while a digital image is
      a binary representation of visual data. These images can take the form of
      photographs, graphics and individual video frames. For this purpose, an
      image is a picture that was created or copied and stored in electronic
      form. The details held by a particular image are known as image
      resolution. The higher the resolution, the more visible the details are in
      an image. Image resolution quantifies how close lines can get to each
      other while remaining visibly resolved. Resolution units are tied to
      physical dimensions, angular subtense or the size of a picture (television
      lines, or TVL).
