    An image is a visual representation of something, while a digital image is a
    binary representation of visual data. These images can take the form of
    photographs, graphics and individual video frames. For this purpose, an
    image is a picture that was created or copied and stored in electronic form.
    <br />
    The details held by a particular image are known as image resolution. The
    higher the resolution, the more visible the details are in an image. Image
    resolution quantifies how close lines can get to each other while remaining
    visibly resolved. Resolution units are tied to physical dimensions, angular
    subtense or the size of a picture (television lines, or TVL).
